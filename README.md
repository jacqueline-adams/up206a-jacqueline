### About Me
I am a second year _Master of Public Policy candidate_ focusing on environmental policy. My interests are far reaching: drinking water access and quality, environmental justice, extreme heat resilience, energy efficiency, and merging behavioral economics with pro environmetnal behaviors. _I enjoy everything environmetnal!_

### __Project Idea Outline__
* Statewide map of drinking water quality.
* Look at [map of California public drinking water systems](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=143794cd74e344a29eb8b96190f4658b) that are "In compliance," "not in compliance," or have "returned to compliance." 
* Compare these data with social capital index from the [Social Capital Project](https://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/scp-index) (drinking water quality map and Social Capital Project data were both submitted via the Google Form). 
* The Social Capital Project looks at state and county level factors related to social capital, or the strength of relationships and cohesion among residents in certain localities. These factors include metrics for Family Unity, Community Health, Institutional Health, and Collective Efficacy. 
* Social capital can be a good indicaor of economic growth, civic engagement, community support, happiness and well-being, and a host of other positive social and economic factors. 
* Mapping water quality with social capital may yield very interesting results, and I hypothesize that areas with lower social captial will also have lower quality drinking water. 
      
### __Class Objectives__ 
 * Become more confortable with spatial analysis 
 * Become more comfortable with coding and begin feeling confident with Python 
 * Become comfortable with GitHub and Jupyter
 * _Learn some marketable skills so I stand out to future employers!_
