This week I read "Global Trends Towards Urban Street Network Sprawl." I found this paper to be 
espeically interesting. It was surprising to learn that as cities increase in size, their 
connectivity can diminish. Which, this is the downside of bulding out instead of in/up.
I think this is especially conerning as we work towards limiting greenhouse
gas emissions, hope to make more resilient and walkable cities, and seek to improve public 
transportation access. Sprawl can negatively harm these efforts.
I was a little bit surprised to learn that the United States street network 
has become more connected, because widespread urban sprawl that caters towards cars is definitely 
the stereotype in the US (which, the paper points out, is still present in places like Los Angeles).
It's important to note that countries like the US and Canada have a boom of expansion and then slow
down relatively. The trend of Southeast Asian sprawl was also noteworthy. 
Sprawl definitely highlights another negative trend that comes along with increased development. 
As someone coming from a policy  background, I am increasingly surprised that city plans and street 
connectedness can not only promote reslieny and address the effects of climate 
change but also improve economic outputs. 





Questions: 

How does urban sprawl impact marginalized and disasvantaged communties?

Is sprawl inevitable, and if so, how can we utilize this spread to our best advantage?
