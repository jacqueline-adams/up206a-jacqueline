## Geoff Boeing Reaction 

I thought this presentation was very fascinating. The ideas surrounding how cities have changed over time is an interesting concept. 
What I found particularly interesting is that the way a locality is designed can highlight when that particular area developed. 
Geoff mentioned that grid-like designs tend to be more walkable and environmentally-friendly, whereas more “spaghetti-like” designs are not. 
Lower income areas are often outlined in grid-like patterns because there has not been much money to invest in these areas as more winding, curvy street outlines 
became popular over time. Further, these areas may have been historically red-lined, meaning that areas with larger Black populations were outlined in red to deter
certain services needed to develop and grow these communities. On the other hand, wealthy areas like Santa Monica are also developed into grid outlines. 
There are so many factors that lead to how a city or locality develops and the overall structure of its city planning. 
I think it is an unfortunate circumstance of systemic racism, and the divestment in urban poor communities that shows these areas are designed for efficiency, 
yet these communities lack access to reliable infrastructure, public transit, and are often situated in food deserts. More broadly, 
it shows how our city planning also reflects the systemic racism that is deeply imbedded in this country.
