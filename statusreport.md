## Status Report on Final Project ## 

### Title: Tracking Water Bill Debt and COVID Cases across California ### 

See the link to my proposal, [here](https://github.com/jacqueline-adams/final-project/blob/main/README.md)


**Status Update:** I have decided to change course on my project a little. Originally, I was just going to focus on water bill debt and demographics and overlay 
that information with water system boundaries. After talking with my research mentor, who told me that the dataset I was planning on using for water system boundaries
has already been used in research extensively, I decided to go another direction. I am now going to either overlay or compare by bill debt and demographic data 
with COVID case numbers, by county. I am currently trying to figure out the best way to convey this information - I can only find COVID data by county, and my 
water bill data is by zip code. I need to determine if this will shed any light on COVID cases and water system strain, or if the comparisons will not be worth doing. Another option is looking for zip-code level COVID numbers, but this might prove tricky. This is currently where I am with the project. 

**Data Update:** I have added the new dataset on COVID numbers from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HIDLTK). I am aslo considering my analysis of water system boundaries (as mentioned previously), and keeping my combined ACS and water debt data. 

**Concerns:**

* Major Concerns: getting my COVID numbers and water debt data to match up in a way that actually drives this research forward; 

* Minor Concerns: mapping zip code data, visually representing all the data I have in a clear way, finding a way to map my Zip code data - I need a dataset with the polygons or some kind of Python function/library that already has the polygons stored somewhere.
