You can find the article [here](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/water-and-drought/article211474679.html).


### Summary 

Though this article is over 2 years old, it still addresses many drinking water-related issues the state of California faces. The article outlines that 360,000 Californians lack access to safe drinking water. The problem is widespread, with 38 counties across the state having at least 1 water system in violation. The state has taken steps to address this issue, first, passing the Human Right to Water Act in 2012, which states that every person "has the right to safe, clean, affordable and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking and sanitary purposes.‚Äù In 2018, Proposition 68 passed, allocating $250 million towards addressing drinking water quality. However, drinking water quality still plagues areas like San Joaquin Valley, where residents' water is polluted with pesticides from nearby agricultural farmlands. Drinking water quality is generally lower in rural areas, lower income areas, unincorporated areas, and localities with smaller water systems that lack the resources to properly clean and treat drinking water. Communities in these areas face a large financial burden - paying for drinking water connection and paying for supplemental bottled water. These smaller water systems themselves make up 80% of water system violations across the state. The article then goes on to address the uncertainty around passage of Prop 68, which has since passed. However, the bill was fairly controversial, as it added a tax to existing water bills, and required that the agricultural industry provide nearly 30 million in relief. 


### Reflection 

This article stood out to me because of its focus on drinking water. My research interests are centered around statewide drinking water quality, and this article perfectly summarized the extent of the problem of poor water quality across the state. While the article is 2 years old, and many steps have been taken to address drinking water quality since, there is much work to be done still. The article itself uses a map to highlight the extent of the problem, and shows (through a color coded scale) how many people are served by water systems that are not in compliance. This feature helped the reader to visualize and conceptualize the far-reaching impacts of poor drinking water. I am interested in conducting similar research during this course (to highlight drinking water quality across the state, but also compile this data with other related socio-demographic factors), and that is why this article stood out to me. However, the article did highlight the need to study other factors related to poor drinking water quality. The article mentioned income, rural areas, and people living near agricultural hubs; however, to understand the extent of the problem, it is important to study other factors present where drinking water quality is low (i.e employment factors, civic engagement, social cohesion, etc). When we study these factors, we can better understand how lack of drinking water affects communities, and we can potentially take steps to address these other factors to holistically address the complicated interconnection of socio-demographics, social cohesion, water quality, and other related factors.
